# myFirstProject
A Go powered "Event Booking" REST API Simple project
This is my very first simple Go project, a stepping stone on my journey to become a backend developer. I'm incredibly excited about this accomplishment and my progress so far.
While this project is a basic implementation, it represents my commitment to continuous learning and growth. I am confident that with dedication and a passion for technology, I will soon be contributing to larger and more complex projects, especially as part of a team. I'm eager to learn from experienced developers and take on new challenges.
